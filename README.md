My code kinda sucks so feel free to edit it to make it work better.
I can't make it work as an executable, so you'll need an IDE (I use pycharm)

Step 1: Using 7zip, extract gamestate
Step 2: Using an IDE, Edit the file paths in the first 4-6 lines to lead to gamestate( make sure to use the correct slash "/")
Step 3: Using notepad or npp, Open gamestate and find your species and their "portrait"
Step 4: Implant the portrait name into the script
Step 5: Change the levels to your preferance and run
